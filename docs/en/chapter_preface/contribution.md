# Contribute Together

!!! success "The beauty of open source"

    The time between the two printings of a paper book is often several years, which makes content updates very inconvenient.</br> However, in this open source HTML book, the time for content updates is shortened to several days or even hours.

Because of the author's limited knowledge, the content of the book is bound to be incomplete and erroneous. Please understand. In addition, I hope you can participate in the creation of this book together. If you find typos, invalid links, missing content, ambiguous text, unclear explanations, or unreasonable text structure, please correct the content to help other readers obtain better learning content. All [contributors](https://github.com/krahets/hello-algo/graphs/contributors) will be shown on our repository homepage, to dedicate our thank to your selfless contribution to the open source community.

## Edit Text & Code

On the top right corner of each page, there is an "Edit" button. You can modify the article by following the steps:

1. Click the "Edit" button, if you see the prompt "You need to fork this repository", please click "Fork this repository";
2. Modify the Markdown source file content;
3. Fill in the change description at the bottom of the page, and then click the "Propose file change" button;
4. After the page jumps, click the "Create pull request" button to create a pull request, and I will check and update the content as soon as possible.

1. Create a new Issue, copy or screenshot the image you need to modify, and paste it in the panel;
2. Describe the problem with the image, and how to modify it;
3. Submit the Issue, and I will draw the image again and replace it as soon as possible.

## Create New Content

If you want to create new content, such as **rewrite chapters, add chapters, modify code, translate code into other programming languages**, you need to implement the Pull Request workflow:

2. Enter the forked repository page, use `git clone` to clone the repository to your computer;
3. Create the new content locally (it is recommended to verify the code correctness by running tests);
4. Commit the local changes and push them to the remote repository;
5. Refresh the repository page and click the "Create pull request" button to submit the pull request.
